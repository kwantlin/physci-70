  <h3 class="heading1">Week 5: 3D Design & Printing </h3> <br> 
  <div class="row content-2">
    
  This week we worked with 3D Design and Printing, extending previous experience with Fusion 360 to creating
  items for printing as well as learning to 3D scan and slice. 
  <br><br>
  To start with the 3D modeling portion of the assignment, I've been very into the game Genshin Impact lately,
  and during a recent in-game event, an item called the Xiao Lantern was released. Due to the rounded contours 
  and patterns of the structure, this would likely be quite difficult to achieve with subtractive methods, especially
  in a cost-effective way since much material would need to be hollowed/shaped away. 
  <br><br>
  <img src="./Xiao_Lantern.png" style="height:700px; width:auto; align-content:centerd; display: block;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" class="img-responsive margin"  alt="Sim circuit">
  <br><br>
  Looking at the above image, I saw that the most challenging portion of the lantern would be to make the 4 leg-like 
  structures near the top. After searching for videos achieving this design, I saw that it could actually 
  be quite easily achieved by creating a pattern in Fusion 360. Here's the video of my inspiration. 
  <br><br>

  <br><br>
  I also noted that my previous attempts to geometrically achieve 
  a shell with extrusion cuts could have been avoided with the simple "Shell" command. From the videos I watched, like the 
  one below, I liked the idea of adding more variety to the lantern body by creating various patterns on the 
  revolving sketch. After trying a few ideas out, I got the below result.
  <br><br>
  <img src="./fusion-thin.png" style="height:700px; width:auto; align-content:centerd; display: block;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" class="img-responsive margin"  alt="Sim circuit">
  <br><br>
  However, though this design was simple enough for printing, as I looked at the sliced model in PrusaSlicer, I 
  remembered my few experiences with 3D printing filament. With such thin weaving pieces, I imagined the likely 
  result would have a lot of "spider-webbing" of excess filament, and the thin pieces might not even remain 
  structurally sound throughout printing. 
  <br><br>
  <img src="./prusa-thin.png" style="height:700px; width:auto; align-content:centerd; display: block;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" class="img-responsive margin"  alt="Sim circuit">
  <br><br>
  
  To avoid this result, I went back to Fusion, and tried to balance 
  increasing the width of the weaving bits as well as just the thickness of the shell. This would lead to 
  a lantern pattern with sufficient gaps for light and increase structural integrity.
  <br><br>
  <img src="./fusion-thick.png" style="height:700px; width:auto; align-content:centerd; display: block;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" class="img-responsive margin"  alt="Sim circuit">
  <br><br>

  Taking this final design to Prusa, I got a much better result, with still around an hour of print time. 
  <br><br>

  <br><br>
  Next, I tried several apps for scanning with my phone. I started with Qlone, since it was free to download. The
  process showed me how images needed to be collected. Qlone showed a dome that your camera would need to sweep through,
  and to improve accuracy, they ask that you first print a base sheet for reference. I found the UI on this app to be difficult,
  since especially for the lower-angle photos, a corner of the base sheet might disappear for a slightly larger item like 
  this multimeter, resulting in difficulty getting clean images. 
  <br><br>
  <img src="./qlone-dome.png" style="height:700px; width:auto; align-content:centerd; display: block;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" class="img-responsive margin"  alt="Sim circuit">
  <br><br>
  The resulting scan was also not the best, since it seemed to have a hard time judging height, as shown below.
  Only after I used the "Flatten" feature did it yield a reasonable result.
  It also cost $20 to get the model files, so I decided to look for alternatives. 
  <br><br>
  <img src="./qlone-mm.png" style="height:700px; width:auto; align-content:centerd; display: block;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" class="img-responsive margin"  alt="Sim circuit">
  <br><br>
  <img src="./qlone-flat.png" style="height:700px; width:auto; align-content:centerd; display: block;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" class="img-responsive margin"  alt="Sim circuit">
  <br><br>
  Nathan suggested Trnio as another iPhone option, only costing $5, so I gave this a shot. It works using both 
  photos and Apple's AR Kit. The UI for the AR Kit is shown below, which slowly builds a point cloud of the object. 
  However, I found that the surroundings of the object in my setting were too easily captured, so I switched to just 
  using images. 
  <br><br>
  <img src="./trnio-arkit.PNG" style="height:700px; width:auto; align-content:centerd; display: block;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" class="img-responsive margin"  alt="Sim circuit">
  <br><br>
  In photo-mode, Trnio similarly seems to want a dome-like sweep around the object. It took several tries, each 
  time requiring tens of photos, to adapt to taking good pictures, pausing at the right moments, and moving very 
  slowly while keeping out of the way of my light source. 
  <br><br>
  <img src="./trnio-obj.PNG" style="height:700px; width:auto; align-content:centerd; display: block;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" class="img-responsive margin"  alt="Sim circuit">
  <br><br>
  My first scan of my clock revealed an interesting optical-illustion phenomenon that would occur if insufficient 
  diversity of images are taken: the front and back of the object might become interchangeable, resulting in weird 
  optical effects as you rotated the resulting 3D object. From looking at other scans that people did with this 
  app, it seems to be a common issue.
  <br><br>
  <img src="./trnio-clock.PNG" style="height:700px; width:auto; align-content:centerd; display: block;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" class="img-responsive margin"  alt="Sim circuit">
  <br><br>

  Adapting to these scanning errors, I did a final set of scans using a Beanie stuffed toy, ensuring that I took 
  images of enough angles, especially the back. Though the scan incorporated some of the surface on which my 
  object rested, this seemed like a common result. The overall scan was quite good!
  <br><br>
  <img src="./trnio-beanie.PNG" style="height:700px; width:auto; align-content:centerd; display: block;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" class="img-responsive margin"  alt="Sim circuit">
  <br><br>
  <img src="./trnio-beanie2.PNG" style="height:700px; width:auto; align-content:centerd; display: block;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" class="img-responsive margin"  alt="Sim circuit">
  <br><br>
  I exported the .obj file to Fusion, and then transitioned it to PrusaSlicer as an .STL file. There, I found it easiest 
  to do modifications like removing the pieces of the surface material by performing a cut. This minimized the presence of excess 
  material from Trnio's scan. 
  <br><br>

  <br><br>
  
  For 3D printing for my final project, I started by looking at previous work on modular robotics. Here's 
  a video I found describing MIT's M-cube. 
  <br><br>
  <iframe width="760" height="515" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hI5UDKaWJOo" style="align-content:centerd; display: block;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
  <br><br>
  Here's another on M-TRAN 3.
  <br><br>
  <iframe width="760" height="515" src="  https://www.youtube.com/embed/4oSavAHf0dg" style="align-content:centerd; display: block;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
  <br><br>
  The common thread between these videos - and an issue for me - is that they rely on decentralized control, which 
  makes sense for the application. However, that means a lot of specialized hardware is necessary, as well as wiring, 
  much of which might not be possible without soldering. Even if I were to somehow attempt wiring together a lot 
  of pieces, it would not be simple to control as most past work relied on a combination of magnets and motor actuators. 
  <br><br>
  Therefore, rather than attempting to 3D model my initial idea, I focused on scaling down. I would like to 
  incorporate some type of TinyML component if possible, and if I want some sort of transformable structure, I know that 
  I need something to do RL in. After looking into some options, I found that Unity's ML Agents software would work well 
  since it allows you to customize everything from the build of your agent to constraints on actions, rewards, etc. Here's 
  an example showing an arm that is being trained to move to target locations.
  <br><br>
  <img src="./unity-ml-agents.png" style="height:700px; width:auto; align-content:centerd; display: block;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" class="img-responsive margin"  alt="Sim circuit">
  <br><br>
  If I were to build a structure that was completely wired togethered in a closed loop, with joint connecting 
  rigid pieces and motors at each joint (or perhaps situated at the center), you can imagine that this structure, even
  if laid flat for just 2D transformations, could take on a variety of shapes. If done as a wall hanging, you 
  could imagine sending it a shape you'd like it to take on, and it would move its joints into the right orientation
  (and perhaps in the right order) to achieve that shape. Whether the ML inference is done on the MCU that controls it 
  or if that's done on a separate device and final motion commands are transmitted over Wifi will need to be determined later. 
  For now, I would need to test the feasibility of doing this all in Unity to see if the transformations and structure can 
  be adequately simulated, as I will need to build the structure based on what I can train for.
