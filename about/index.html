      I'm a senior at Harvard studying Computer Science with a secondary in Economics and Chinese language citation.
      I'm part of Winthrop House, but am currently living at home in Elkview, West Virginia. In my other classes, I'm 
      passionate about robotics and AI and also find creative applications of these fields fascinating. 
      At Harvard, I worked at the Derek Bok Center for Teaching and Learning, played chamber music, and organized 
      education conferences in China. In my free time, I'm usually running, reading Murakami novels, and watching anime.
