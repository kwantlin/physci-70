  <h3 class="heading1">Week 4: Microcontroller Programming </h3> <br> 
  <div class="row content-2">
  This week our task was to program a microcontroller to do something. In class we explored how to operate
  the motor with the Metro Board, including how to change the direction and speed of its rotational motion.
  We also continued to build on prior weeks' knowledge of the other kit parts and learned how to incorporate
  them into our circuits for more advanced sensing and response.
  
  <br><br>

  My idea for this homework was heavily inspired by the work we did on the motors, as I saw an opportunity 
  to reconstruct the typically abstracted-away features of wheel motion in robots. I initially considered 
  working to build a PID controller from scratch in this way, but felt that there was more I could do to 
  incorporate other elements of the kit to produce something more novel.
  
  <br><br>

  I'd previously seen a video of a drone moving toward light using a camera and reinforcement learning, 
  and this practical application got me interested in light-driven motion. The natural tool to use for this 
  was the phototransistors in our kit, of which we had a total of 4 (not counting the 2 IR photo transistors).
  
  <br><br>

  First, I would need to understand better what a phototransistor, or even a normal transistor, did. I started by
  reading this 
  <span class="underline--magical" onclick="location.href='https://www.electronics-notes.com/articles/electronic_components/transistor/what-is-a-phototransistor-tutorial.php#:~:text=Phototransistor%20operation,an%20ordinary%20transistor%20to%20light.&text=The%20light%20enters%20the%20base,electron%20pairs%20to%20be%20generated.';" style="cursor: pointer" >
    tutorial on phototransistors.
  </span>

  <br><br>

  To briefly summarize my key takeaways from this article, the phototransistor operates by converting 
  photons to electrons using a "reverse biased base-collector junction." The electric field generated moves
  electrons into the "emitter. As a result the photodiode current is multiplied by the current gain Î² of 
  the transistor." Thus, a phototransistor essentially operates as a current amplifier, and with more current
  running across the phototransistor, voltage increases. This voltage is what the pin connected to the Metro 
  will measure.

  <br><br>

  Another piece of knowledge I gained, which was supplemented by this 
  <span class="underline--magical" onclick="location.href='https://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=38896.0';" style="cursor: pointer" >
    forum discussion on phototransistor sensitivity
  </span>
  was that the resistor connected to a phototransistor controls the flow of current. Phototransistors are not
  the most sensitive or responsive, but to increase sensitivity, the resistor in the collector of the transistor should be increased 
  The smaller the amount of current flowing through the transistor the less light it takes to switch it. A 100kOhm resistor or more is recommended.
  The down side is that the smaller the current the slower the response but for my application, this shouldn't be too crucial.
  
  <br><br>

  I then proceeded to find an example of a phototransistor circuit available and the associated 
  <span class="underline--magical" onclick="location.href='https://www.instructables.com/Light-Sensor-Photoresistor-Arduino-Tinkercad/';" style="cursor: pointer" >
    tutorial on how to construct and understand it.
  </span>

  <br><br>
  
  Now, given that voltage sensing is crucial to get accurate input from phototransistors, I investigated
  how best to connect them, and found that 
  <span class="underline--magical" onclick="location.href='https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-connect-photodiodes-to-have-more-voltage-Is-it-connected-in-series-or-parallel';" style="cursor: pointer" >
    in parallel
  </span>
   works best for accurate and safe readings.
  
   <br><br>
  
  I wanted to start by setting up the LEDS in parallel to ensure accurate readings, and thus built the 
  following circuit on TinkerCAD, not wanting to damage any phototransistors before I was certain of my
  circuit (as I'd done previously with an LED). 
  
  <br><br>
  
  <img src="./parallelcircuit.png" style="height:700px; width:auto; align-content:centerd; display: block;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" class="img-responsive margin"  alt="Sim circuit">

  
  <br><br>
  
  Then I built this circuit in person and added phototransistors. The goal of this was to try to get variable
  readings from each direction, and be able to sense light direction as a result. Then I could build motion
  into this construction to enable a robot to move toward light. 
  
  <br><br>
  
  <img src="./first-proto.png" style="height:700px; width:auto; align-content:centerd; display: block;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" class="img-responsive margin"  alt="Sim circuit">

  
  <br><br>
  
  However, an immediate challenge I realized was that light needed to hit the base of the phototransistor quite
  directly. Therefore my initial idea of discerning light direction from multiple indirect readings would not
  be feasible, unless the phototransistors were densely clustered, as in the above image. I did want to 
  eventually mount this on a robot, and for any suitable-sized bot, the phototransistors would need to be
  much more spread out. Thus, I needed to decouple the phototransistors and rely on moving toward direct readings.
  (i.e. move toward the sensor exhibiting the highest significant reading). For these phototransistors, it
  seemed that the "resting" voltage was in the 30-40 range, so I would need to set a threshold above this to trigger 
  a valid response. Whether or not I would be able to implement PID control would also rely on the motor.
  
  <br><br>
  
  In the process of deciding how to mount the phototransistors properly, I realized that I would need to 
  somehow extend them with wire to line a robot body. I decided to use these male-to-female wires to plug
  in the phototransistors and enable them to be stuck through the inside of a robot body.
  
  <br><br>
  
  <img src="./extend-photo.png" style="height:700px; width:auto; align-content:centerd; display: block;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" class="img-responsive margin"  alt="Sim circuit">

  
  <br><br>
  
  From there, I attached a motor in a similar fashion as last week, sticking up through the inside of a round
  container, allowing the phototransistors to stick out. 
  
  <br><br>
  
  <img src="./top-view-done.png" style="height:700px; width:auto; align-content:centerd; display: block;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" class="img-responsive margin"  alt="Sim circuit">
  
  <br><br>
  

  From there, I tested the motor for minimum speed, given that I wanted a limited range of motion. After 
  running several tests, I realized that the maximum speed for a motor would require publishing an analog 
  signal of 50/255 via PWM, which controls the speed of the motor. Lower speeds would result in no motion or 
  only occasional motion. I also needed to figure out the speed of the motor, and since speed control 
  seemed to scale more quickly than I'd like, I decided to use time to control the angular distance of rotation.
  After performing some tests with the load I had attached to motor, I determined publishing 50 via PWM over 
  650ms, the motor would make one full-circle rotation. I also noted that in order to reverse the motion of 
  the motor to clockwise, I would need to publish 255-50 via PMW, and reverse the directional digital signal from 
  "LOW" to "HIGH". Thus, I had the directional control I needed to be able to rotate a flag attached to the motor 
  to face the direction of the stongest/last strongest light source. This could then be extended in future 
  weeks to actually moving the body of the robot on wheels in response to light. 
  
  <br><br>
  
  A quick note before I head into further programming discussion: for anyone using MacOS BigSur and looking
  to use the mu-editor to run CircuitPython, at the time of writing, it will help to run 

  <code>export QT_MAC_WANTS_LAYER=1</code>

  first. Otherwise, you will, like me, get stuck with a mu-editor that becomes unresponsive immediately after opening. 
  I chose to program in Arduino's C++ only because I wanted to have more experience in this language. The added 
  challenge I realized after trying to implement more advanced data structures usually in the Standard Library 
  was that these packages were too large for an MCU. Therefore, I would need to rely on more basic 
  data structures, such as those discussed 
  <span class="underline--magical" onclick="location.href='https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/54284/how-to-find-the-index-of-the-maximum-value-in-an-array';" style="cursor: pointer" >
    here
  </span>
  to do things like find the argmax of an array, which would otherwise be one line in CircuitPython. Definitely
  a good learning experience!
  
  <br><br>
  
  My code assumes that the flag starts facing the "1st" phototransitor, so between runs, I adjust accordingly.
  I noticed immediately after a few runs that I would need to perform tuning adjustments to get accurate motion, especially 
  since the motion was not completely exact, especially when moving through different angles. The numbers I mentioned 
  earlier for speed and time of motor motion are the final tuned numbers. I noted that rather than moving 
  always clockwise, it might be better for accuracy and style to have the motor move through the minimum
  angle to reach its destination. Therefore, a few additional <code>if</code> statements were necessary to achieve 
  the final product:
