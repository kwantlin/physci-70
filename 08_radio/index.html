  <h3 class="heading1">Week 8: Radio Communication </h3> <br> 
  <div class="row content-2">
    This week we began our investigation of communication between devices. 
    <br><br>
    Starting in lab, I implemented the LED communication over WIFI example, as shown here:

    <br><br>

    I also did successfully run the ESP32-CAM example, but after attempting to recreate it later for video purposes, I miswired a connection, which led to some odd hissing.
    Since then, I've had issues getting it to be recognized on my laptop's ports, but I will come back to this in future weeks.
    <br><br>

    Before I ran the Servo example, which required me to use the following package to interface with the motor using the Huzzah, I found I was having some 
    issues getting the motor to work properly still. Since I couldn't disambiguate whether the source of the error was the transmitting or receiving device, I 
    backpedalled to do a simple button and LED example. Here is the code I used.
    <br><br>

    Transmitting code:
    <br><br>

    <pre><code class="language-arduino">
    const int out_pin = 7;
    const int button_pin = 11;

    void setup() {
      pinMode(button_pin, INPUT_PULLUP);  //This is the button pin.
      pinMode(out_pin, OUTPUT);         // pin 5 for digital Write

      Serial.begin(9600);        //for the USB serial devices, this baud rate is meaningless - can be "0"
    }

    void loop() {
      int buttonState = digitalRead(button_pin);
      Serial.println(buttonState);
      digitalWrite(out_pin, buttonState);
      delay(10);
      }
    </code></pre>
    <br><br>

    Receiving code:
    <br><br>

    <pre><code class="language-arduino">

    int led=13;

    Servo myservo;  // create servo object to control a servo

    void setup() {
      pinMode(12, INPUT);   // pin 7 for digital read
      pinMode(led,OUTPUT);
    }

    void loop() {
      int readnum = digitalRead(12);
      Serial.println(readnum);
      if (readnum==0)
    {
      digitalWrite(led,HIGH);
    }
    else
    {
      digitalWrite(led,LOW);
    }
    }
      </code></pre>
      <br><br>

    Here is the video demo:
    <br><br>

    <iframe width="760" height="515" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qWqtkfJ_iB8" style="align-content:centerd; display: block;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    <br><br>

    Upon coming back to this work today to try to extend it to more complex devices or finally get the Servo working since I now knew I could rely on the information coming in on pin 12,
    I was getting the following error:
    <br><br>

      <pre>
        Warning: Could not auto-detect Flash size (FlashID=0xffffff, SizeID=0xff), defaulting to 4MB Compressed 8192 bytes to 47...
      </pre>
      <br><br>

    This persisted for the Huzzah regardless of what sketch I tried to upload, including even the basic Blink sketch. Thank goodness I got my demo video from above on an earlier day!
    <br><br>

    I found some
    <span class="underline--magical" onclick="location.href='https://github.com/espressif/esptool/issues/394'" style="cursor: pointer" >
      blog posts 
     </span>
     about this issue, but no matter how many times I hit reset during upload, I saw no success. This is definitely a pressing issue that I will resolve soon hopefully.
     <br><br>

     However, I do know that I can get reliable wired communication over this Pin 12, so I imagine that once this Flash issue is resolved (perhaps a wiring issue), I will be able to extend it to variety of other devices.

     Update: reconnecting my board later fixed the issue!
