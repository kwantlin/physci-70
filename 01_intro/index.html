    <br><br>

    My current interest is in building an autonomous agent with some sort of transformable property. I've seen recent 
    work done on origami robotics that I find super interesting, but I don't think anything has been done yet that involves
    a single starting structure that can completely adapt to new forms and tasks, without needing to put on different 
    "outfits". The larger motivating idea would be to build something that can imitate a 3D structure from 2D visual input, 
    thus enabling a robot to contort into shapes of varying size and structural integrity that can navigate small spaces, 
    provide structural support, grasp an object, etc. all via the same piece of hardware. It is unlikely that every task
    could be achievable by one structure, but it might be possible to encompass a family of similar tasks or tasks that
    could likely occur where the robot is set to deploy.
    <br><br>
    Version 1: Depending on the parts that I have available and knowledge/time, my hope is to start simple. One approach for my final project might
    rely mostly on individual solid pieces. By fabricating some components that
    can attach to each other at will, it might be possible to create a structure that can alternate between 4-legged locomotion and a 
    stable cube structure. 
    <br><br>
    Version 2: It might also be possible to achieve this with magnetic force that can be turned on and off, and even to 
    approximate structures with a combination of applied forces (think force-directed graphs).
    <br><br>
    Version 3: An approach that is more complex but more similar to origami would be mimick/create a self-folding piece of paper 
    that can create various 3D structures through its own programming. I would need to start by mimicking the material, which will 
    be challenging since along a certain axis, it might need to be able to both fold and exert force.
    With certain degrees of freedom established on the material, I would then program one origami structure into it, a sequence of 
    folds that it will reproduce on its own to create the 3D structure. This will be complex not only due the many possible combinations
    of forces necessary, but also because the origami will likely need to fold itself while sitting on a flat surface. Finding a suitable
    origami design to create this proof-of-concept project will be necessary. 
    <br><br>
    This final project will also leave me open to create extensions in the future to train the material in simulation. I imagine feeding in 
    an approximate 3D outline and asking the robot to "Fold yourself such that you maximize the interior volume you cover while 
    minimizing the exterior volume covered." Though this hypothesis is untested, I imagine with a suitable threshold and many training
    runs in a 3D simulator that this specification will cause the paper to generally approximate the input structure. 
    Ensuring suitable structural soundness would be a secondary concern to address.

    Here are a few sources I used to modify the template we were provided.

    Dynamically resizing layout:

    To help me resize images within the blocks and maintain a more dynamic layout, I used CSS 
    <span class="underline--magical" onclick="location.href='https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox.asp';" style="cursor: pointer" >
      flex boxes
    </span> to create the general structure.
    <br><br>

    To signal to the user that a text element was being moused-over, I used an 
    <span class="underline--magical" onclick="location.href='https://codepen.io/devilishalchemist/pen/ZYLZay';" style="cursor: pointer" >
      underline feature
    </span>
     that would appear on hover.
    <br><br>

    To signal to the user that a clickable image element was being moused-over, I used text
     <span class="underline--magical" onclick="location.href='https://www.w3schools.com/howto/tryit.asp?filename=tryhow_css_image_overlay_fade';" style="cursor: pointer" >
      fade-in feature
    </span> 
    that would appear on hover.
    <br><br>

    Lastly, I created a 
    <span class="underline--magical" onclick="location.href='https://www.w3schools.com/howto/tryit.asp?filename=tryhow_css_responsive_header';" style="cursor: pointer" >
      responsive header
    </span> 
    that "sticks" to the top of the screen, allowing easy navigation between pages:
