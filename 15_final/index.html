     January 28, 2021: Proposal
     <br><br>

     My current interest is in building an autonomous agent with some sort of transformable property. I've seen recent 
     work done on origami robotics that I find fascinating, but I don't think anything has been done yet that involves
     a single starting structure that can completely adapt to new forms and tasks. The big goal would be to build
     something that can imitate a 3D structure from 2D visual input, but this is just the motivating idea.

     Depending on the parts that I have available and knowledge/time, my plan is to start by trying to by attempting 
     some sort of force-based response to input, say info on a force-directed graph or even response to touch. Touch 
     maybe be more mathematically tractable for this project, and I would like to create a physical design that can 
     reconfigurate in response to force input, perhaps to resist breakage. A more mathematically ambitious alternative
     would be to create a structure that can mimick/approximate that of a visual input.
